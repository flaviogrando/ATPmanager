# ATPmanager
Software to automatically generate and control massive simulations of electrical systems using ATP (Alternative Transient Program)

# What is ATPmanager?
It is software to create .atp simulation files and perform simulations automatically. ATPmanager makes it possible to reproduce series of predetermined events and to conduct mass simulations.

# Why is useful?
This software is useful for creating large-scale simulations (although it is possible to simulate only one case at a time). There is no limit on the number of successive simulations, without human intervention.

# How to use?
