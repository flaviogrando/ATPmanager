# ATPmanager
This code was used to generate tens of thousand simulations used in the submitted article:

GRANDO, F. L., LAZZARETTI, A. E., MORETO, M.; "The Impact of PMU Data Quality on Event Classification in Distribution Systems". Subjected to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid in March 2021 (UNDER REVIEW).


# What is ATPmanager?

ATPmanager ia a software to automatically generate and control massive simulations of electrical systems using ATP (Alternative Transient Program). This software creates .atp simulation files and performs simulations on a large-scale resulting in a dataset of Matlab files. ATPmanager makes it possible to reproduce series of predetermined events and to conduct mass simulations.

# Why is useful?
This software is useful for creating large-scale simulations (although it is possible to simulate only one case at a time). There is no limit on the number of successive simulations, without human intervention.

# How to use?
